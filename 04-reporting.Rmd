# Reporting

Using `papaja`, it is possible to run all your analyses from within an R Markdown document.
Any output from R is included as you usually would using R Markdown.
By default the R code will not be displayed in the final documents.
If you wish to show off your code you need to set `echo = TRUE` in the chunk options.

This section describes how you can include the results of your analyses can be included in text.
It starts with simple numerical values (like a sample mean) and then continues with more-complex
output, like figures, tables, and the results from statistical models and hypothesis tests.


## Numerical values

```{r printnum-values, echo = FALSE}
age_mean <- 22.8395
age_sd <- 3.7846237542894
```

Consider a basic example, where you want to include a mean and a standard deviation into text:
`printnum()` can be used to include numeric values in the text.
The function performs the rounding and optionally omits leading zeros in accordance with APA guidelines:

```{r inline-printnum, eval = FALSE, highlight = FALSE}
Participants mean age was `r printnum(age_mean)` years ($SD = `r printnum(age_sd)`$).
```

The above line is rendered as follows:

> Participants mean age was `r printnum(age_mean)` years ($SD = `r printnum(age_sd)`$).

`printnum()` is quiet flexible and passes its arguments to the underlying base function `formatC()` 
(CAVE: We are currently considering to switch to `format()`.),
so changing the number of digits after the decimal point or the character to be used to indicate the 
decimal point (e.g., from a point `"."` to a comma `","`) is always possible.

```{block2, hook-note, type = "rmdnote"}
`papaja` automatically applies `printnum()` to any numbers that a printed in inline code chunks.
Hence, `` `r age_mean` `` and `` `r printnum(age_mean)` `` are effectively identical and both yield "22.84".
```

`papaja` additionally provides a shorthand version of `printnum()`, namely `printp()`, with defaults for correct typesetting of $p$ values (e.g., $p < .001$ instead of $p = 0.000$).

Typeset numerical values for greater control
- `printnum()`
- `printp()` as shorthand for *p* values

```{r}
printnum(c(143234.34557, Inf))
```

```{r}
printnum(42L, numerals = FALSE, capitalize = TRUE)
```

```{r}
printp(c(1, 0.0008, 0))
```



## Figures

As in any R Markdown document, you can include figures in your document.
Figures can either consist of plots generated in R or external files.
In accordance with APA guidelines, figures are not displayed in place but are deferred to the final pages of the document.
To change this default behavior set the option `figsintext` in the [YAML front matter] to `yes`.

Figures are saved as 300 dpi PDF and PNG

- e.g., `my_manuscript_figures/figure-latex/chunk-name-1.pdf`
- Change defaults using chunk options (`dev` and `dpi`)

### R-generated figures

Any plot that is generated by an R code chunk is automatically included in your document.
Hence, a simple call to `plot()` is sufficient to create a figure:

(ref:simple-base-plot)
A basic scatterplot of the `cars` dataset.

```{r simple-base-plot, fig.cap = "(ref:simple-base-plot)"}
plot(cars)
```

Figure display size, resolution, file format and many other things can be controlled by setting the corresponding chunk options.
Refer to the [plot-related `knitr` chunk options](https://yihui.name/knitr/options/#plots) for an overview of all options.
In `papaja`-documents, by default, all figures as saved as vectorized PDF and pixel-based PNG files at a resolution of 300 DPI, which should in most cases be sufficient for print publication.
When the target document format is PDF the vectorized PDF files are included; when the target document format is DOCX the pixel-based PNG files are included.
The files can be found in the `mydocument_files` folder that is generated when `mydocument.Rmd` is knitted.

Note, if you define transparent colors in your plots (e.g., when you defining colors using `rgb()`), the rendered document will always display the pixel-based PNG files, regardless of the target document format.
Given the lossless compression in PNG and the decent resolution of 300 DPI this should not be a problem in print.


#### `papaja` plot functions

Factorial designs are ubiquotous in experimental psychology but notoriously cumbersome to visualize with R base `graphics`.
That is why `papaja` provides a set of functions to facilitate plotting data from factorial designs.

The functions `apa_beeplot()`, `apa_lineplot()`, `apa_barplot()`, and the generic `apa_factorial_plot()` are intended to provide a convenient way to obtain a publication-ready figure while maintaining enough flexibility for customization.
The basic arguments to these functions are all the same, so you only need to learn one syntax to generate different types of plots.
Moreover, it is easy switch between the different types of plots by changing the name of the called function.

Consider the following example of a so-called beeswarm plot:

```{r echo = FALSE}
load("data/mixed_data.rdata")
```

(ref:beeswarm-caption)
An example beeswarm plot. Small points represent individual observations, large points represent condition means, and error bars represent 95% confidence intervals.

```{r beeswarm2, fig.cap = "(ref:beeswarm-caption)", echo = TRUE, dev.args = list(bg = 'white')}
apa_beeplot(
  data = mixed_data
  , id = "Subject"
  , dv = "Recall"
  , factors = c("Task", "Valence", "Dosage")
)
```

A `data.frame` that contains the data in long format is passed to the `data` argument.
The other arguments expect the names of the columns that contain the subject identifier `id`,
the dependent variable `dv`, and the between- or within-subjects `factors` of the design.
Currently, zero to four factors are supported.

For each cell of the design, the functions plot

1. central tendency,
2. dispersion, and
3. names of dependent variable, factors and levels, and optionally a legend.

Mesures of central tendency and dispersion default to the mean and 95% confidence intervals.
However, the arguments `tendency` and `dispersion` can be used to overwrite these defaults and plot other statistics.
For example, to plot within-subject rather than between-subject confidence intervals you can set `dispersion = within_subjects_conf_int`.
If the data encompass multiple observations per participant-factor-level-combination, these observations are aggregated.
By default, the condition means are computed but you can specify other aggregation functions via the `fun_aggregate` argument.

The visual elements of the plots can be customized by passing options to the arguments `args_points`, `args_error_bars`, `args_legend`, and so on.
These arugments take named lists of arguments that are passed on to the respective `graphics` functions, such as `points()`, `arrows()`, and `legend()`.
Consider the following code and the resulting Figure\ \@ref(fig:customized-plot) for a customized version of the previous beeswarm plot.


(ref:customized-plot-caption)
A customized beeswarm plot. Note that, by default, the swarm inherits parameters from the args_points argument. Small points represent individual observations, large points represent means, and error bars represent 95% within-subjects confidence intervals.

```{r customized-plot, fig.cap = "(ref:customized-plot-caption)"}
apa_beeplot(
    data = mixed_data
  , id = "Subject"
  , dv = "Recall"
  , factors = c("Task", "Valence", "Dosage")
  , dispersion = within_subjects_conf_int
  , main = c(expression(italic(A)~"dosage"), expression(italic(B)~"dosage"), expression(italic(C)~"dosage"))
  , ylab = "Number of correctly recalled words"
  , args_points = list(cex = 2, bg = c("skyblue4", "indianred3", "seagreen4"), col = "white")
  , args_swarm = list(cex = 1.2)
  , args_error_bars = list(length = 0.02, col = "grey20")
  , args_legend = list(x = "bottom", inset = 0.05)
  , args_y_axis = list(las = 1)
)
```


- Utilize variable labels

These plot functions also utilize variable labels, with some $\LaTeX$ math support (see `?latex2exp::TeX`)

```{r labelled-beeplot, eval = FALSE}
variable_labels(cosmetic_surgery) <- c(
  Post_QoL = "Quality of life post surgery ($\\bar{x}_{post}$)"
)

apa_beeplot(
  id = "ID"
  , dv = "Post_QoL"
  , factors = c("Reason", "Surgery", "Gender")
  , data = cosmetic_surgery
  # , ylab = "Quality of life post surgery"
  , las = 1
  , args_legend = list(x = 0.25, y = 30)
  , args_points = list(bg = c("skyblue2", "indianred1"))
  , args_error_bars = list(length = 0.03)
)
```


#### Setting global plot options

As noted in the APA guidelines (p. 153) figures in an article should be consistent and in the same style.
Hence, it is desireable to define plot styles once rather than every time a new plot is created.
When using `graphics` plot functions global options can be set using `par()`.
For example, the size of labels and symbols can be controled with `cex`:

(ref:par-in-chunk)
A variant of the example beeswarm plot with larger labels and symbols.

```{r par-in-chunk, fig.cap = "(ref:par-in-chunk)"}
par(cex = 1.2)
apa_beeplot(
  data = mixed_data
  , id = "Subject"
  , dv = "Recall"
  , factors = c("Task", "Valence")
)
```

However, the use of `par()` is restricted in `knitr`.

```{block2, knitr-par-warning, type = "rmdcaution"}
By default, `knitr` resets `par()` for every chunk; `par()` needs to be called anew in every chunk that creates a plot.
```

While there are advantages to this behavior it impedes defining a consistent plot style.
Although not very convenient, it *is* possible to set global plot options in `knitr` and therefore also in `papaja`.
The following example illustrates how to make `knitr` execute a specified call to `par()` before executing code in a given chunk.
Here we rotate the $y$-axis label (`las = 1`), sets a regular font and increases the size of the main title (`font.main = 1`, `cex.main = 1.05`).

```{r knitr-par, eval = FALSE}
# Ensure that par()-settings are retained across chunks
knitr::opts_knit$set(global.par = TRUE)

# Define a function that sets desired global plot defaults
par(font.main = 1`, `cex.main = 1.05, las = 1)
```

The customizations apply to all subsequently generated plots.
It is, thus, advisable to add this code at the top of the R Markdown document shortly after the YAML front matter.

These same limitations do not apply to users of `ggplot2`.
Custom themes can be set as default as usual and are subsequently applied to all plots created with `ggplot()`.
`papaja` provides a template `theme_apa()` that we feel is well suited to create publication-ready plots.
The following example demonstrates how to set a default theme.

```{r ggplot}
# Cosmetic surgery dataset from
# Field, A. P., Miles, J., & Field, Z. (2012). Discovering statistics using R. London: Sage.
load("data/cosmetic_surgery.rdata")

ggplot(
    cosmetic_surgery
    , aes(x = Base_QoL, y = Post_QoL, color = Reason)
  ) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(
    x = "Baseline quality of life"
    , y = "Quality of life post surgery"
  ) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  theme_apa(box = TRUE) +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.2, 0.8))
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
theme_set(theme_apa())
```

### Figure captions

The chunk option `fig.cap` sets a figure caption.
In principle, it is possible to define a figure caption simply by passing a character string to `fig.cap`.
However, we strongly recommend that you use [text references](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/markdown-extensions-by-bookdown.html#text-references)---a feature of the `bookdown` package---instead.
A text reference consist of a unique label and the corresponding text that it represents.
Text references can be defined as follows:

```
(ref:my-figure-caption)
This is a figure caption for my figure.
```

The text reference can now be inserted in the chunk options (or anywhere else), e.g. `fig.cap = "(ref:my-figure-caption)"`.
The use of text references has several advantages:

1. The use of Markdown and $\LaTeX$ syntax is not well supported in `fig.cap`.
For example, `\` and `_` must be escaped to prevent either R or $\LaTeX$ from erroring.
Moreover, Markdown formatting and citation syntax is not supported at all.
None of these limitations apply to text references.
2. Long figure captions can impair the readability of the document when they are added directly to the chunk options.
3. Text references are subject to RStudio spell checking, whereas the contents of `fig.cap` is not.
4. Changing text reference does constitute a change to the code chunk and hence does not cause the cache of a chunk to be discarded.
5. Text references can include inline code chunks.

We recommend to define the text reference for a figure caption just above the corresponding code chunk.

```{block2, fig-cap-caution, type = "rmdcaution"}
The figure caption defined in `fig.cap` is used for all figures that are created in the respective chunk.
If multiple figures are created the caption will be duplicated.
Unless this behavior is desired, only one figure should be created per chunk.
```


- Caption is used for every figure in chunk
- Only one figure per chunk
- Combine multiple plots into one figure (e.g., `layout()`)

If a given figure is tall or the figure caption is extensive, it may flow of the page of a PDF document.
There are two approaches to accomodate long figure captions or tall figures. You can adjust the line spacing/font size of the caption or use a separate list of figure captions.

#### Line spacing and font size

As mentioned [Adjusting line spacing], you can adjust the line spacing but also the font size of figure captions.
For single-spaced script-size figure captions, add the following to the YAML front matter:

~~~yaml
header-includes:
  - \usepackage{setspace}
  - \captionsetup[figure]{font={stretch=1,scriptsize}}
~~~

For other font size options see the [LaTeX Wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Fonts#Sizing_text).


#### List of figure captions

To add a list of figure captions after the reference section, add the following to the YAML front matter:

~~~yaml
figurelist: yes
~~~

Additionally you can suppress the captions below *all* figures by adding LaTeX code to the document preamble:

~~~yaml
header-includes:
  - \captionsetup[figure]{textformat=empty}
~~~

If you would rather suppress figure captions only where necessary you can instead use `knitr` to do this.
To remove the caption below a figure set `fig.cap = " "` and instead set the figure short caption via the chunk option `fig.scap = "My figure caption"`:

~~~
(ref:figure-caption) This is a long figure caption!

```{r fig.cap = " ", fig.scap = "(ref:figure-caption)", out.width = "\\textwidth"}`r ''`
plot(cars)
```
~~~

```{block2, fig-scap-caution, type = "rmdcaution"}
To ensure that `fig.scap` takes effect, `knitr` requires that the chunk specifies `out.width`, `out.height`, or `fig.align`, as explained [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27250635/short-caption-fig-scap-in-knitr-not-working).
```



## Tables

For prettier tables, I suggest you try `apa_table()`, which builds on `knitr`'s `kable()`.

(ref:mixed-table-caption)
Descriptive statistics of correct recall by dosage.

(ref:mixed-table-note)
This table was created with apa_table().

```{r results = 'asis', echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
descriptives <- mixed_data %>% group_by(Dosage) %>%
  summarize(
    Mean = mean(Recall)
    , Median = median(Recall)
    , SD = sd(Recall)
    , Min = min(Recall)
    , Max = max(Recall)
  )
descriptives[, -1] <- printnum(descriptives[, -1])

apa_table(
  descriptives
  , caption = "(ref:mixed-table-caption)"
  , note = "(ref:mixed-table-note)"
  , escape = TRUE
)
```

Of course popular packages like `xtable`[^xtable] or `tables` can also be used to create tables when knitting PDF documents.
These packages, however, cannot be used when you want to create Microsoft Word documents because they rely on $\LaTeX$ for typesetting.
`apa_table()` creates tables that conform to APA guidelines and are correctly rendered in PDF and Word documents.
But don't get too excited.
In papaja, table formatting is somewhat limited for Word documents due to missing functionality in pandoc (e.g., it is not possible to have cells or headers span across multiple columns).

[^xtable]: When you use `xtable()`, table captions are [set to the left page margin](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/42209/centering-tables-in-document-class-apa6).

As required by the APA guidelines, tables are deferred to the final pages of the manuscript when creating a PDF.
To place tables and figures in your text instead, set the `figsintext` parameter in the YAML header to `yes` or `true`, as I have done in this document.
Again, this is not the case in Word documents due to limited pandoc functionality.
The bottom line is, Word documents will be less polished than PDF.
The resulting documents should suffice to enable collaboration with Wordy colleagues and prepare a journal submission with limited manual labor.


```{r results = "asis", include = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
employee <- c("$\\alpha$",'$\\alpha$','$\\alpha$')
salary       <- c(21000, 23400, 26800)
startdate   <- as.Date(c('2010-11-1','2008-3-25','2007-3-14'))
dt              <- data.frame(employee, salary, startdate)

apa_table(
  dt
  , caption = "Descriptive statistics of correct recall by dosage."
  , note      = "This table was created with apa\\_table() and here's
some latex $\\alpha$"
  , escape = FALSE
  , format   = "latex"
)
```

<!-- 1. To use LaTeX code inside a table you have to set escape = FALSE. Otherwise, elements of the LaTeX syntax (such as backslashes) will be printed as is. -->

<!-- 2. If you set escape = FALSE you need to manually escape symbols that would otherwise be interpreted as LaTeX code, such as underscores (see note). -->

<!-- 3. When you pass backslashes as character strings you need to escape the backslash with one additional backslash because R uses backslashes to denote special characters, such as \t for tab or \n for newline, and will interpret \a as newline, I think. The remaining lpha is meaningless in LaTeX math environments and will cause an error. -->

<!-- 4. If you want to write symbols in any part of the table use $ instead of $$, which is used in text to format equations as distinct equations in new inset paragraphs. -->

<!-- (5. format = "latex" is not required if you use the function inside an R Markdown document)  -->


`apa_table()` extends `knitr::kable()`

- Designed to create table designs from the APA manual
- Does not perform any calculations
- Can merge multiple `data.frame` of the same structure contained in a `list`
- Much more powerful in PDF documents<br />(see `apa_table_example.Rmd`)
- Remember to set chunk option `results = "asis"`!

`kableExtra` is another powerful alternative

## Results from statistical tests

Output from statistical models and tests needs to be properly formatted before it
can be included in text.
For this purpose, we created the function `apa_print()`.
Simply drop the results from a statistical test (e.g. a $t$ test or an ANOVA)
into `apa_print()`, and you will get an output object (a `list`) that contains all you need
to report the analysis according to APA guidelines.
`apa_print()` currently supports output objects from a variety of statistical models/tests,
including $t$ tests, ANOVA, linear regression.
For a full list of supported output objects, see Table \@ref(tab:supported-s3-methods).


```{r supported-s3-methods, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
print_classes <- gsub("apa_print\\.", "", as.character(utils::methods("apa_print")))
print_classes <- print_classes[!grepl(",", print_classes)]
print_classes <- c(print_classes, rep(NA,  (4 - length(print_classes) %% 4) * (length(print_classes) %% 4 > 0)))
print_classes <- matrix(print_classes, ncol = 4)
colnames(print_classes) <- apply(print_classes, 2, function(x) {
  first_letters <- tolower(substr(x, 1, 1))
  first_letters <- c(first_letters[1], tail(first_letters, 1))
  first_letters[is.na(first_letters)] <- "z"
  col_names <- if(first_letters[1] == first_letters[2]) first_letters[1] else paste(first_letters, collapse = "-")
  toupper(col_names)
})
print_classes[is.na(print_classes)] <- ""
print_classes[grepl("lsm|emm|glht|ref\\.grid|BayesFactor", print_classes)] <- paste0(print_classes[grepl("lsm|emm|glht|ref\\.grid|BayesFactor", print_classes)], "<sup>*</sup>")
knitr::kable(print_classes, format = "html", escape = FALSE)
```

```


### htest (*t* tests, correlations, etc.)

The results of a $t$ test (regardless of the exact type of $t$ test) are typically stored in an `htest` object.

```{r}
# Cosmetic surgery dataset from
# Field, A. P., Miles, J., & Field, Z. (2012). Discovering statistics using R. London: Sage.
load("data/cosmetic_surgery.rdata")

t_out <- t.test(
  x = cosmetic_surgery$Post_QoL
  , y = cosmetic_surgery$Base_QoL
  , paired = TRUE
)

# Let's see what the apa_print() output looks like
apa_print(t_out)
```

As you can see, `apa_print()` returns a list of four elements:
List element `estimate` contains the sample estimate of mean difference;
element `statistic` contains the result of the NHST with test statistic, *df*s, and *p* value;
element `full_result` contains both information combined.
The fourth element, `table`, contains a table containing test results; while this is `NULL` for a $t$ test,
it will be quiet interesting for ANOVA or linear model results, as you will see in the next subsections.

### lm (linear regression)

The results of a linear model are stored in an `lm` object.

```{r}
lm_out <- lm(formula = Post_QoL ~ Base_QoL + BDI, data = cosmetic_surgery)
apa_lm <- apa_print(lm_out)
```

Again, `apa_print` returns a four-elements list.
`apa_lm$table` contains a complete regression table that can be passed to `apa_table()` to get a full regression table, see Table \@ref(tab:lm-table; remember to set the chunk option `results = "asis"`).

```{r lm-table, results = "asis"}
apa_table(
  apa_lm$table
  , caption = "A full regression table."
  , escape = FALSE
)
```


```{r}
lm_res <- lm(Post_QoL ~ Base_QoL + BDI, data = cosmetic_surgery)
lm_res_apa <- apa_print(lm_res, observed_predictors = TRUE)
lm_res_apa$estimate$Intercept
```

> `r gsub("\\\\", "\\", lm_res_apa$estimate$Intercept)`

--

```{r}
lm_res_apa$full_result$modelfit$r2
```

> `r gsub("\\\\", "\\", lm_res_apa$full_result$modelfit$r2)`

Tables produced by `apa_print()` have variable labels

```{r}
lm_res_apa$table
```



Tables produced by `apa_print()` have variable labels

```{r}
variable_labels(lm_res_apa$table)
```


```{r}
variable_labels(letters) <- "Alphabet"
letters[1:15]
```

```{r}
variable_labels(cars$speed) <- "Speed [m/h]"
cars[1:15, "speed"]
```


Variable labels can be added to any `vector` or `data.frame`

```{r}
variable_labels(cars) <- c(
  speed = "Speed [m/h]"
  , dist = "Stopping distance [ft]"
)
cars[1:3, ]
```

Variable labels are attributes of the variables that make up the `data.frame`


- Conflicting implementations
- Ours is, in principle, compatible with `Hmisc`


```{r}
variable_labels(cars$dist)
```

```{r}
cars[1:15, "dist"]
```


#### anova (model comparisons)

...

### anova, Anova, Anova.mlm (Analysis of Variance -- ANOVA)

*Foreword -- you can skip this if you are not interested in background*.
Amongst psychologists, analysis of variance is a still-popular and frequently used technique.
In base R, however, analysis of variance is not implemented in a way that is too useful
for psychologists, as the `aov`-function in the stats package does not provide the much sought-after
Type-$\rm{I\!I\!I}$ sums-of-squares. A variety of R packages has emerged to fill the gap, e.g.
`car` [@R-car], `ez` [@R-ez], and `afex` [@R-afex].
Unfortunately, each ANOVA function provides different output objects that need to be digested by `apa_print()`.
To do so, we rely on the package authors to return standardized result objects (i.e., S3/S4 classes).
For this reason `apa_print()` does not support results from the popular `ezANOVA()`.
The object returned by this function has no class to inform us about its contents and, thus, cannot be processed.
We recommend you try one of the other available packages, e.g. `aov_ez()` from the `afex`-package.

*Functionality*.

```{r anova-apa, message = FALSE}
cosmetic_surgery_anova <- afex::aov_ez(
  data = cosmetic_surgery
  , dv = "Post_QoL"
  , id = "ID"
  , between = c("Clinic", "Gender")
)
apa_anova <- apa_print(cosmetic_surgery_anova)
```

Now, you can report the results of your analyses like so:

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
Clinic (`r apa_anova$full$Clinic`) and patient gender affected post-surgery quality of life, `r apa_anova$full$Gender`. However, the effect of gender differed by clinic, `r apa_anova$full$Clinic_Gender`.
```

Which will yield the following text:

> Clinic (`r apa_anova$full$Clinic`) and patient gender affected post-surgery quality of life, `r apa_anova$full$Gender`. However, the effect of gender differed by clinic, `r apa_anova$full$Clinic_Gender`.

Again, you can easily create a complete ANOVA table by passing `recall_anova_results$table` to `apa_table()`, see \autoref{ref:anova}.

```{r anova-table, results = 'asis'}
apa_table(
  apa_anova$table
  , caption = "A really beautiful ANOVA table."
  , note = "Note that the column names contain beautiful mathematical copy: This is because the table has variable labels."
)
```

## Caching expensive computations

If R codes take a long time to run, results can be cached

<smaller>
<code class = "markdown hljs remark-code" style = "background: #F2F2F2;">&#96;&#96;&#96;{r heavy-computation, .highlight[cache = TRUE]}<img src="workshop_files/figure-html/chunk_buttons.png" style = "float:right;" /><br /># Imagine computationally expensive R code here<br />
&#96;&#96;&#96;</code>
</smaller>

`my_manuscript_cache` directory is created that contains
- Computed objects
- List of loaded R packages in `__packages`


The next time the chunk is executed

- If unchanged, cached results are loaded
- If changed, cache is discarded and code is executed anew

--

Packages are not reloaded, which cause problems in subsequent uncached chunks

- Do not include `library()`-calls in cached chunks!

--

Load cache into an interactive R session using `lazyLoad()`



```{block2, chached-library-warning, type='rmdcaution'}
If possible at all, avoid caching `library()`-calls.
Subsequent use of functions from these packages in non-cached chunks will throw errors!
```

To avoid incorrect results due to caching, dependencies should be specified

<smaller>
<code class = "markdown hljs remark-code" style = "background: #F2F2F2;">&#96;&#96;&#96;{r chunk1, cache = TRUE}<img src="workshop_files/figure-html/chunk_buttons.png" style = "float:right;" /><br />x <- 5<br />
&#96;&#96;&#96;</code><br />

<code class = "markdown hljs remark-code" style = "background: #F2F2F2;">&#96;&#96;&#96;{r chunk2, cache = TRUE, .highlight[dependson = "chunk1"]}<img src="workshop_files/figure-html/chunk_buttons.png" style = "float:right;" /><br />x <- x + 5<br />
&#96;&#96;&#96;</code>
</smaller>

If code in `chunk1` changes, `chunk2` is recomputed


To avoid incorrect results due to caching, dependencies should be specified

```{r eval = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(autodep = TRUE)
knitr::dep_auto()
```

See [knitr cache examples](https://yihui.name/knitr/demo/cache/) for details



Control when cache is discarded

- Ignore changes to comments

```{r eval = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache.comments = FALSE)
```

- Discard cache when random seed changes

```{r eval = FALSE}
opts_chunk$set(cache.extra = knitr::rand_seed)
```

I would recommend to always set these options

- Discard cache if data are modified

```{r eval = FALSE}
opts_chunk$set(cache.extra = file.info("data.csv")$mtime)
```

- Discard cache if the R environment changes

```{r eval = FALSE}
opts_chunk$set(
  cache.extra = list(R.version, sessionInfo())
)
```


If time permits, always discard all cached results (i.e., delete `my_manuscript_cache` directory) and reknit the document before submission to ensure that all results are based on the current R code!


### Inserting variables before they have been computed

R code in R Markdown documents in executed from top to bottom.
Hence, variables are not available before the code chunk in which they are defined has been executed.
However, sometimes it may be desireable to report a variable in a document before the corresponding code chunk.
A common example is to include the sample size or focal test statistics in the abstract.

Cached code chunks store their results in a cache database in the subfolder `my_document_cache` (default).
The function `knitr::load_cache()` can be used to access cache databases and report results of a chunk anywhere in the document.
For the following example, we'll assume that we want to report the sample size in the abstract.
The sample size is calculated in the method section:


    `r ''````{r, sample-size, cache = TRUE}
    n <- nrow(cosmetic_surgery)
    ```


To report this variable in the abstract we need to use an inline code chunk in the YAML front matter field:

```{yaml, eval = FALSE}
---
abstract: |
  This is the abstract.
  Our sample size was n = `r knitr::load_cache(label = "sample-size", object = "n")`.
---
```

When the document is first rendered the object `n` in the code chunk `sample-size` has not yet been computed and `knitr::load_cache()` will insert `"NOT AVAILABLE"` instead.
The next time the document is rendered, the results of the previous run have been saved as cache database.
These results will be loaded and inserted into the abstract.

```{block2, knitr-load-cache, type = "rmdnote"}
For variables computed later in the document, `knitr::load_cache()` can only ever display the result of the previous run---if the cached code is changed, the document has to be rendered twice to display the new result.
```
