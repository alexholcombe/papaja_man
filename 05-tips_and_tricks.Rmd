# Tips and Tricks

- Spell check functionality in RStudio

Although often overlooked, RStudio can check your spelling

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("workshop_files/figure-html/spellcheck.png")
```


- New line for each sentence

## Global chunk options

It can be useful to set chunk options globally for all (following) chunks to avoid retyping or copy-and-pasting

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Save all plots as 600 DPI TIFF-files
knitr::opts_chunk$set(dev = "tiff", dpi = 600)

# Do not evaluate subsequent chunks (debugging or fine-tuning)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval = FALSE)
```

See the [knitr chunk options and package options](https://yihui.name/knitr/options/) for an overview of settings

## Meaningful chunk names

## RStudio

1. Document outline

RStudio provides a handy document outline view

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("workshop_files/figure-html/rstudio-outline.png")
```


<!-- If you discover an error in a data file, never modify it directly, but instead write code to correct the value. Explain why you made the fix. -->

<!-- Before you finish for the day, make sure you can knit the notebook (if you’re using caching, make sure to clear the caches). That will let you fix any problems while the code is still fresh in your mind. -->


## Splitting an R Markdown document

Some authors may prefer to split long manuscripts into multiple component files for better clarity.
There are two basic strategies to split R Markdown documents that can be combined or used in isolation: sourcing R scripts and splitting the R Markdown document.
If the R Markdown document contains a lot of code, it may be helpful to disincorporate parts of the code, such as reading, merging, restructuring, and relabeling data files.
The R scripts can then be executed at the respective section of the document using `source()`.

Some authors may prefer to split long manuscripts into a master or parent document and multiple children.
The master document, for example, consists of the YAML front matter and includes the children, which are themselves R Markdown documents without a YAML front matter.
To include a child document, insert an empty chunk and provide the path to the R Markdown document in the chunk option `child`.
    
It may be preferable to split long documents into multiple files

~~~
```{r child = "introduction.Rmd"}`r ''`
```

```{r child = "method.Rmd"}`r ''`
```

```{r child = "results.Rmd"}`r ''`
```

```{r child = "discussion.Rmd"}`r ''`
```
~~~

## Workflow

- Don't edit raw data
- Don't set a working directory
- Generate graphics from R code
- Don't edit word documents
- Relative paths



### Comparing documents

In revisions, it can be helpful to highlight all changes.

* for DOCX, use the Microsoft Word combine feature
* for PDF, use [`latexdiff`](https://3142.nl/latex-diff/) on $\LaTeX$ source documents
  1. Create $\LaTeX$ file with highlighted changes
  2. Compile to PDF in RStudio

Notes on PDF method:

The .tex files are generated when you knit your .rmd document. Make sure you save the .tex file from *before* you make any modifications.

You can now visit [`latexdiff`](https://3142.nl/latex-diff/) and copy/paste in the contents of `manuscript_old.tex` and `manuscript_new.tex`, or (if you are a command line ninja install [`latexdiff`](https://3142.nl/latex-diff/) on your own system). This will generate output which you can copy/paste into a file `manuscript_with_changes.tex`.

Now open this file `manuscript_with_changes.tex` in RStudio and click "Compile to PDF" in the top bar.

N.B. Will not track changes in the front matter (affiliations, abstract)

### Counting words

1. Lua word count filter in [`rmdfiltr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rmdfiltr/index.html)
    - Easy to apply to any document format in R Markdown
    - Counts words in `pandoc` abstract syntax tree
    - If applied after `pandoc-citeproc`, counts rendered citations
    - Excludes figure and table captions
    - Provides separate word count for reference section
    - [Comparable in precision](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rmdfiltr/vignettes/wordcount.html) to other methods
2. [`wordcount`](https://github.com/benmarwick/wordcountaddin)
    - RStudio addin counts words in R Markdown documents
    - Good for quick interactive use
    - [Less precise](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rmdfiltr/vignettes/wordcount.html) than other methods; cannot, for example, count rendered citations
3. [`texcount`](http://app.uio.no/ifi/texcount/)
    - Counts words in TeX documents
    - If used with `pandoc-citeproc`, reference section must be removed manually prior to counting
    - [Comparable in precision](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rmdfiltr/vignettes/wordcount.html) to other methods
4. Microsoft Word word count
    - Use `apa6_docx()`-format
    - Reference section must be removed manually prior to counting
    - [Comparable in precision](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rmdfiltr/vignettes/wordcount.html) to other methods

If you are using `pandoc-citeproc` for references, exclude the reference section before counting words



## Best practices

1. Load all R packages in the first code chunk
    - Never include `install.packages()`
2. Set a seed for random number generators<br />(e.g., `set.seed()`)
3. Never use `setwd()`!
4. Use relative paths or load files from a permanent location
5. Use meaningful chunk names
6. Keep R code close to the corresponding prose
7. Document R and R-package versions<br />(e.g., `devtools::session_info()`)
8. Make sure you can knit without errors before going home



## Troubleshooting

### R

<!-- Copy and paste from R4DS -->
<!-- Troubleshooting R Markdown documents can be challenging because you are no longer in an interactive R environment, and you will need to learn some new tricks. The first thing you should always try is to recreate the problem in an interactive session. Restart R, then “Run all chunks” (either from Code menu, under Run region), or with the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Alt + R. If you’re lucky, that will recreate the problem, and you can figure out what’s going on interactively. -->

<!-- If that doesn’t help, there must be something different between your interactive environment and the R markdown environment. You’re going to need to systematically explore the options. The most common difference is the working directory: the working directory of an R Markdown is the directory in which it lives. Check the working directory is what you expect by including getwd() in a chunk. -->

<!-- Next, brainstorm all the things that might cause the bug. You’ll need to systematically check that they’re the same in your R session and your R markdown session. The easiest way to do that is to set error = TRUE on the chunk causing the problem, then use print() and str() to check that settings are as you expect. -->


Fixing bugs in R Markdown documents can be challenging

- The code is run in a new non-interactive R session
- Try is to recreate the problem in your interactive session
    1. Restart R (`Session > Restart R` or<br /><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>F10</kbd>)
    2. Run all chunks (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>)
    3. Compare the working directories (e.g., use `getwd()` in a code chunk)
