## Author name disambiguation

As per APA style, citations in `papaja` documents will be disambiguated if the bibliography file contains multiple authors with the same family but different given names.
This can be a nuisance if the bibliographic information is not maintained meticulously.
Entries such as `author = {John Doe}` and `author = {J. Doe}` are taken to be different authors and will be disambiguated (i.e. "John Doe (1986)" and "J. Doe (1986)").

`papaja` provides an APA CSL file that disables author name disambiguation.
To use this variant insert the following into YAML front matter:

~~~yaml
disambiguate_authors: no
~~~

Note that using this style can create the false impression that two works are authored by the same author when really they were not.
For example, `author = {John Doe}` and `author = {Jane Doe}` will be displayed as "Doe (1986a)" and "Doe (1986b)".

If you prefer $\LaTeX$ to render the bibliographic information, we recommend the following approach to disable author name disambiguation:

~~~yaml
lang              : "en-EN" # Optional, added for clarity

biblio-style      : "apa"
biblatexoptions   : "uniquename=false"
header-includes:
  - \DeclareLanguageMapping{english}{english-apa}

output:
  papaja::apa6_pdf:
    citation_package: biblatex
~~~

Specifying `lang` is optional in this case, because `en-EN` is the default.
`pandoc` converts `en-EN` to `english` and inserts it into the document preamble.
Hence, `english` needs to be mapped to `english-apa`.
Similarly, if you want, say, British English you would have to adapt the above as follows:

~~~yaml
lang              : "en-GB" # Required
header-includes:
  - \DeclareLanguageMapping{british}{british-apa}
~~~

A general drawback to this approach is that `biblatex` does not operate on any text in the YAML front matter.
This can be a problem when, for example, the abstract contains citations.
Fortunately, this drawback can be resolved by defining the respective text for the YAML front matter as a [Text references].
Replace the text of the abstract in the YAML front matter by a unique identifier:

~~~yaml
abstract: (ref:abstract)
~~~

`(ref:abstract)` is a stand-in for text that you define in the body of the R Markdown document (e.g., right after the YAML front matter):

~~~
(ref:abstract) This is the abstract [@doe1986].
~~~

This text will now be processed and citations will be generated as expected.
For details see [Text references].

## Adjusting line spacing

According to the APA guidelines, "Tables may be submitted either single- or double-spaced." [p. 141; @american_psychological_association_publication_2010].
Adjusting the line spacing of table contents is currently not supported in `papaja`.
However, as usual it is possible to adjust the spacing in PDF documents by including additional $\LaTeX$ code.
If you use `apa_table()`, including the following in the YAML front matter will result in single-spaced tables with double-spaced caption and table note:

```{yaml}
header-includes:
  - \usepackage{setspace}
  - \AtBeginEnvironment{tabular}{\singlespacing}
  - \AtBeginEnvironment{lltable}{\singlespacing}
  - \AtBeginEnvironment{tablenotes}{\doublespacing}
  - \captionsetup[table]{font={stretch=1.5}}
  - \captionsetup[figure]{font={stretch=1.5}}
```

Similarly, the line spacing of figure captions can be adjusted as follows:

```{yaml}
header-includes:
  - \usepackage{setspace}
  - \AtBeginEnvironment{tabular}{\doublespacing}
  - \AtBeginEnvironment{lltable}{\doublespacing}
  - \AtBeginEnvironment{tablenotes}{\doublespacing}
  - \captionsetup[table]{font={stretch=1.5}}
  - \captionsetup[figure]{font={stretch=1}}
```


## Writing dissertations

While `papaja` is primarily intended for preparing journal articles and preprints, it is possible to create entire dissertations using it.
This is particularly useful for cummulative dissertation formats that include individual papers as separate chapters.
If the individual papers were written with `papaja`, it is straight forward to include them in the dissertation document.
The first dissertation written using `papaja` that I'm aware of is *Contingency Awareness in Evaluative Conditioning: Investigations Using Subliminal Stimulus Presentations* by @heycke_contingency_2018.
Tobias provides a [brief tutorial](http://rpubs.com/theycke/380678) on how he used `papaja`.
